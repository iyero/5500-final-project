## Project Context

This analysis was developed as the final project for **MUSA 5500: Geospatial Data Science in Python** at the University of Pennsylvania Weitzman School of Design.

The project demonstrates proficiency in:

- Raster analysis and terrain processing
- Integration of multiple geospatial data sources
- Zonal statistics and demographic analysis
- Interactive web mapping
- Reproducible research workflows

## Why Honolulu?

Honolulu County presents a compelling case study for flood risk analysis:

- **Personal connection:** I grew up on Oahu and have seen firsthand how flooding affects island communities
- **Island geography** creates a bounded study area with clear coastal exposure
- **Diverse terrain** from sea level to 1,200m+ within a compact area
- **Dense population** concentrated in low-lying coastal zones
- **Real policy relevance** given climate change and sea level rise projections
- **High-quality data** availability from USGS and Census

## Data Sources

| Dataset | Source | Access |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Digital Elevation Model | USGS 3DEP | [National Map](https://apps.nationalmap.gov/downloader/) |
| Hydrography | USGS NHD | [National Map](https://apps.nationalmap.gov/downloader/) |
| Census Boundaries | Census TIGER/Line | [Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html) |
| Population Data | ACS 2020 5-Year | [Census API](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html) |

## Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations

- **Static risk model:** Does not incorporate probabilistic flood modeling or climate projections
- **Population distribution:** Assumes uniform distribution within block groups
- **Single hazard focus:** Does not address other hazards (tsunami, wildfire, etc.)

### Potential Extensions

- Incorporate NOAA sea level rise projections
- Add FEMA flood zone data as validation layer
- Model population change scenarios
- Conduct evacuation route analysis
- Compare with insurance claims or historical flood records
