# High Tide Ahead
### Flood Risk and Population Exposure in Honolulu County, Hawaii
:::

## Overview

Honolulu County faces significant flood risk from multiple sources: coastal inundation, storm surge, and riverine flooding from the island's numerous streams and waterways. This analysis develops a composite flood risk model for Oahu and estimates population exposure across approximately 887,000 residents.

The project combines elevation data, hydrological features, and demographic information to identify flood-prone areas and quantify who lives in harm's way.

## Key Findings

::: {.stat-box .high-risk}
::: {.stat-number}
86,462
:::
**Residents in High-Risk Areas** (9.7%)
Living below 3m elevation or within 100m of inland waterways
:::

::: {.stat-box .moderate-risk}
::: {.stat-number}
142,190
:::
**Residents in Moderate-Risk Areas** (16.0%)
Elevation 3-8m or within 100-500m of waterways
:::

::: {.stat-box .low-risk}
::: {.stat-number}
632,045
:::
**Residents in Low-Risk Areas** (71.3%)
Above 8m elevation and more than 500m from waterways

## Study Area

Oahu is the most populous of the Hawaiian Islands, home to Honolulu and roughly two-thirds of the state's population. The island's geography presents unique flood risk challenges:

- **Coastal exposure:** The entire island perimeter faces potential storm surge and sea level rise impacts
- **Steep terrain:** Rainfall rapidly concentrates in streams that can flash flood
- **Dense development:** Urban Honolulu concentrates population in low-lying coastal areas
- **Limited escape routes:** Island geography constrains evacuation options
