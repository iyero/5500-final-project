## Risk Model Components

The flood risk model combines elevation and proximity to inland waterways, weighted 70% and 30% respectively.

![Flood Risk Model Components](outputs/figures/flood_risk_components.png)

Panel (A) shows the digital elevation model, with the Ko'olau and Wai'anae mountain ranges clearly visible. Panel (B) classifies elevation into risk categories. Panel (C) shows proximity risk based on distance to streams and rivers (coastline excluded). Panel (D) presents the final composite risk classification.

## Comprehensive Risk Map

![Comprehensive Flood Risk Assessment](outputs/figures/10_comprehensive_risk_map.png)

The top 5 highest-risk block groups are marked with stars. High-risk areas concentrate along the southern coastal plain (Waikiki, Ala Moana, Pearl Harbor) and in windward valley floors.

## Population Exposure

## Data Note
The figures and statistics below are for **Oahu only**. Honolulu County technically includes small Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, which were filtered out during visualization. The raw CSV files in the repository contain data for all of Honolulu County (773 block groups, 979,682 residents), while the figures shown here are subsetted to Oahu (703 block groups, 886,849 residents).

### By Population (Oahu Only)

| Risk Category | Population | Percent |
|---------------|------------|---------|
| High | 86,462 | 9.7% |
| Moderate | 142,190 | 16.0% |
| Low | 632,045 | 71.3% |
| **Total** | **886,849** | **100%** |

### By Land Area

| Risk Category | Percent of Land |
|---------------|-----------------|
| High | 28.8% |
| Moderate | 12.2% |
| Low | 59.1% |

The disparity between land area and population percentages reflects that high-risk coastal areas tend to be less densely populated than inland urban zones.

## Dashboard Summary

![Flood Risk Dashboard](outputs/figures/11_dashboard_summary.png)

### Key Statistics (Oahu Only)

- **Total Population Analyzed:** 886,849
- **High Risk Exposure:** 86,462 (9.7%)
- **Block Groups Analyzed:** 703
- **Mean Risk Score:** 1.37 / 3.0

## Top High-Risk Areas

The following census block groups have the highest composite risk scores:

| Rank | Block Group | Population | Risk Score |
|------|-------------|------------|------------|
| 1 | 900010 | 0 | 3.00 |
| 2 | 037034 | 0 | 2.83 |
| 3 | 001083 | 1,296 | 2.82 |
| 4 | 802001 | 537 | 2.80 |
| 5 | 012022 | 1,104 | 2.75 |

Note: Block groups with zero population are typically parks, industrial areas, or military installations.

## Key Takeaways

::: {.callout-important}
## Summary Findings (Oahu Only)

1. **86,462 residents** (9.7% of Oahu's population) live in high flood risk areas
2. High-risk areas concentrate along the **southern coastal plain** and **windward valley floors**
3. The **elevation component** drives most of the risk classification on this island geography
4. **Stream proximity** adds localized high-risk corridors inland from the coast
5. Mean risk score of **1.37** indicates most block groups are relatively low-risk

## Limitations

Several factors affect interpretation of these results:

- **Uniform population assumption:** Population is allocated proportionally by area, not actual residential density
- **Static analysis:** Does not account for future sea level rise or development changes
- **No storm modeling:** Risk categories are based on physical exposure, not probabilistic flood modeling
- **Resolution tradeoffs:** 10m resolution balances detail with computational feasibility
